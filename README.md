## Description  
The **DMQL Project** is a web application that provides **insights and statistics for IPL matches**.  
It allows users to select a **season** and a **statistic** to view detailed match information.  

## Data Sources  
The data for this project is derived from **Kaggle's IPL datasets**, ensuring accuracy and reliability.  

- A table was created in **PostgreSQL** using the `CREATE` command.  
- The `.csv` file was then **imported using PostgreSQL's import feature**.  

## Key Features  
✅ **Interactive interface** for selecting seasons and statistics.  
✅ **Real-time updates** based on user selections.  
✅ **Visually appealing presentation** of match data.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **Node.js**  
- **Express.js**  
- **PostgreSQL**
